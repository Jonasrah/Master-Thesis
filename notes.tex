- Conceptual models in games can be the game world or the theme of the game. e.g. a game set in an old Aztec-like temple would give the player a mental model of there possibly would be residing traps and puzzles, like they have learned from for example Indiana Jones. Totten. Rollings
``object-oriented analysis, or data structure or database design.
For example, when the designers of a hotel registration system debate
whether a reservation should be recorded as a feature of a room or of a
day or of a person, they are designing the ontology of their system. At
the same time, ontology is also sometimes used to refer to the ele-
ments of a users conceptual modelthe model either of the users own
work or of the systems operation. Users understandings are a matter of
some significance to system designers, who needs to design a system
model that will fit the users ontology.'' dourish 130.

- Keyboard Sport uses natural mapping

- Norman's natural mapping and best, second-best and third-best mapping is not connected in any way. It is unclear what the difference between a good utilisation of mapping and natural mapping and since 'best mapping' is where controls are mounted directly to the controlled, natural mapping only qualifies as either second-best or third-best.

- The way the scroll wheel is interacted with becomes a carrier of meaning in the sense that one can scroll rapidly to gain speed or slow for precision.

- Action-perception loop == Feedback loop?

- Logical constraints can provide coupling: A room with a door and a button. Logical conclusion: Button operates door. Connected to decoupling.

- Framework can also be used to decouple unintended action-perception loops.

 - Affordance addition: "An affordance is a three-way relationship between the environment, the organism, and an activity" \cite[p. 118]{dourish}.

 - Dourish and meaning:
  - A user's ontology == a user's conceptual model (p. 129).
  - So embodied interaction is not possible for the player, but what about the agent that the player controls? Schutz intersubjectivity.
