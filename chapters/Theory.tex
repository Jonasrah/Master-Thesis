\section{Inherent Feedback}
Inherent feedback means that the performed action and the feedback it gives is closely coupled. The feedback of the action should act as an innate consequence. To design for inherent feedback one must consider four issues: "The action of the user and the feedback of the product occur in the
same location. [...] The direction of the product's feedback is the same as the action of
the user. [...] The modality of the product's feedback is the same as the modality
of the user's action. [...] The product's feedback and the user's action coincide in time." \cite{howdonald}.

\section{Feedforward}
Feedforward is the information an object gives before the interaction. This is given both by the way the object looks, but also the action that it requires i.e. communicating the purpose of the action. For applying feedforward in a design a direct approach should be taken. It takes behaviour and action as its starting point. Instead of focusing on semantics where metaphors and resemblance is relied on, the authors instead believes that meaning is created in the interaction, therefore relying highly on perceptual and bodily skills. \cite{howdonald}.
